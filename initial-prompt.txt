I need to build a local-only Python application with a simple GUI.
This app will never be deployed to a server - it's purely for local desktop use.

**Tech Stack Requirements:**
- **Backend:** Python 3.12+
- **UI Framework:** CustomTkinter (modern, native-looking Tkinter wrapper with better styling)
  - Alternative if CustomTkinter doesn't work: PyQt6 (more powerful but heavier)
  - Fallback: Standard Tkinter (most compatible, basic styling)
- **Project Structure:** Single-window application with clean separation between UI and business logic

**Core Requirements:**
- Single window interface with drag-and-drop support
- Clean MVC/MVP architecture (UI separate from logic)
- Type hints throughout
- Virtual environment setup (venv)
- Requirements.txt for dependencies
- Simple setup instructions in README

**Why CustomTkinter:**
- Native Python, no external dependencies beyond pip
- Modern, clean aesthetics out of the box
- Built-in dark mode support
- Excellent drag-and-drop support via tkinterdnd2
- Lightweight and fast for local apps
- No web server overhead

Please create the initial project structure with:
1. Main application entry point
2. Separate UI module
3. Separate business logic module
4. Configuration for the virtual environment
5. Basic window with placeholder for my specific requirements


When the project template is setup, see the starting specifications in PRD.md and build a MVP working application.
(Please modify and clean up the formatting in the PRD as needed)

A critical design choice you will need to make is the appropriate ML model that will underpin the application.
Think deeply about this choice and implement it accordingly.  The app will rely heavily on a learning model trained
on images of handwritten text.  Assume the user has the necessary paid accounts
and can provide API keys if necessary for these LLM providers:  OpenAI, Grok, and Claude.  The user also has
a paid account with Hugging Face, but pick the best tool for the job.  It's OK if it is not free.
